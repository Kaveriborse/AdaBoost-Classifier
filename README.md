# AdaBoost-Classifier

```
This repository contains an implementation of the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) classifier, a popular ensemble learning method for classification tasks. AdaBoost combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier. This implementation provides a flexible approach to AdaBoost, allowing customization of parameters, integration of custom weak learners, and application to various datasets for classification tasks.
